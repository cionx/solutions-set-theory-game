intro x ha
have hac : x ∈ A ∪ C := Or.inl ha
have hbc := h1 hac
rcases hbc with hb | hc
exact hb
have hac2 : x ∈ A ∩ C := And.intro ha hc
have hbc2 : x ∈ B ∩ C := h2 hac2
exact hbc2.left

-- Another proof:
-- A
-- = A ∩ U
-- = A ∩ (C ∪ Cᶜ)
-- = (A ∩ C) ∪ (A ∩ Cᶜ)
-- ⊆ (B ∩ C) ∪ ((A ∪ C) ∩ Cᶜ)
-- ⊆ (B ∩ C) ∪ ((B ∪ C) ∩ Cᶜ)
-- = B ∩ (C ∪ Cᶜ)
-- = B ∩ U
-- = B
-- But this proof uses LEM and is also a pain to formalize
-- because we dont’t have access to Ex Falso Quodlibet!
